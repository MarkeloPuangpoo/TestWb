    <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUwxKWT6m7U">Back to December - Taylor swift</a></h3>
    <p>I'm so glad you made time to see me</p>
    <p>How's life? Tell me, how's your family?</p>
    <p>I haven't seen them in a while</p>
    <p>You've been good, busier than ever</p>
    <p>We small talk, work and the weather</p>
    <p>Your guard is up and I know why</p>
    <p>Because the last time you saw me</p>
    <p>Is still burned in the back of your mind</p>
    <p>You gave me roses and I left them there to die</p>
    <p>So this is me swallowin' my pride</p>
    <p>Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night</p>
    <p>And I go back to December all the time</p>
    <p>It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you</p>
    <p>Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine</p>
    <p>I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright</p>
    <p>I go back to December all the time</p>
    <p>These days, I haven't been sleepin'</p>
    <p>Stayin' up playin' back myself leavin'</p>
    <p>When your birthday passed and I didn't call</p>
    <p>Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times</p>
    <p>I watched you laughin' from the passenger's side</p>
    <p>And realized I loved you in the fall</p>
    <p>And then the cold came, the dark days</p>
    <p>When fear crept into my mind</p>
    <p>You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye</p>
    <p>So this is me swallowin' my pride</p>
    <p>Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night</p>
    <p>And I go back to December all the time</p>
    <p>It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you</p>
    <p>Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine</p>
    <p>I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind</p>
    <p>I go back to December all the time</p>
    <p>I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile</p>
    <p>So good to me, so right</p>
    <p>And how you held me in your arms that September night</p>
    <p>The first time you ever saw me cry</p>
    <p>Maybe this is wishful thinkin'</p>
    <p>Probably mindless dreamin'</p>
    <p>But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right</p>
    <p>I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't</p>
    <p>So if the chain is on your door, I understand</p>
    <p>But this is me swallowin' my pride</p>
    <p>Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night</p>
    <p>And I go back to December</p>
    <p>It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you</p>
    <p>Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine</p>
    <p>I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright</p>
    <p>I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind</p>
    <p>I go back to December all the time</p>
    <p>All the time</p>
